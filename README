Below are the settings that should be placed in settings.py and local_settings.py. Fill in the value for your own specific app.

/*** Settings ***/


/*** Local Settings ***/

# MODULE can be one of 'all_ok' or 'oauth'. If using 'oauth', client applications will need an oauth key/secret pair.
SPOTSEEKER_AUTH_MODULE = 'spotseeker_server.auth.MODULE'

# A list or tuple of usernames allowed to use methods that modify server data (PUT, POST, DELETE.)
SPOTSEEKER_AUTH_ADMINS = []

# Custom validation can be added by adding SpotForm and ExtendedInfoForm to org_forms and setting them here. (For example, in the spot form, MODULE could be default.DefaultSpotForm or org_forms.UWSpotForm.)
SPOTSEEKER_SPOT_FORM = 'spotseeker_server.org_forms.MODULE'
SPOTSEEKER_SPOTEXTENDEDINFO_FORM = 'spotseeker_server.org_forms.MODULE'
